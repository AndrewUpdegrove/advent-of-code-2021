# Crab Rave on the Ocean Floor

This is a write up for me to talk about the process of the elaboration I did on the day 7 puzzle of Advent of Code 2021. This discussion relies on knowing the background of the initial problem. If you haven't read [AoC Day 7 problem](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/7), go read that first.

## Problem Restatement

I wanted to complicate the initial problem statement, because why not? In the initial problem the crabs needed to get in a line to shoot a super powered blast into the underground cave system. But what if the crab submarine's aren't powerful enough to make it through. Each crab can only remove a little bit of earth, but if they all formed a large circle on the ocean floor and then drilled down the could "spy-move laser glass cut" through the floor and make a whole for the submarine. So here is the proposed alternate problem definition.

> Santa's elves use an Ohio class submarine which measures 170 meters in length. In order to get into the subterranean cave the crabs will need to form a circle on the ocean floor so their laser drills can blast a whole to slip through. The number of crab submarines, their speed, where they go, and how they get there may change as the problem progresses.
